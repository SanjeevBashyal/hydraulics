    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most advanced topic. Unsteady flow is described by the **Saint-Venant Equations**, a pair of non-linear hyperbolic PDEs. We'll use the 1D conservative form (assuming a wide rectangular channel, so $A=bh$ and we can analyze per unit width):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuity:** $ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (hu)}{\\partial x} = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Momentum:** $ \\frac{\\partial (hu)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (hu^2 + \\frac{1}{2}gh^2)}{\\partial x} = gh(S_0 - S_f) $\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve these, we use a **Finite Difference Method**. We discretize both time ($t$) and space ($x$) into a grid. We will implement the **Lax-Friedrichs scheme**, which is an explicit scheme known for its simplicity and relative stability (due to numerical diffusion).\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to update the state at grid point $j$ and time step $n+1$ based on the states at neighboring points ($j-1, j+1$) at the current time step $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical concept for explicit schemes is the **Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition** for stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C = \\frac{(|u| + c) \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $c = \\sqrt{gh}$ is the celerity of a shallow water wave. This means our time step $\\Delta t$ must be small enough that information doesn't travel more than one spatial step $\\Delta x$ in a single time step."
